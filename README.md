# freesleep_script
Setup script for Freesleep install on Eightsleep Pod3 with SD Card
Run using:
sudo sh ./modify_eight_sleep.sh

If you don't run as sudo, then the script won't set the resulting file's permissions correctly and it will cause problems trying to log in as root.

The script has hard coded variables that must be set before running.
